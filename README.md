***A COMPARATIVE STUDY OF
MACHINE LEARNING MODELS
ON CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE***


PROJECT OVERVIEW

A worldwide public health issue, chronic kidney disease (CKD) has numerous clinical signs and complicated symptoms. Improving patient outcomes requires early diagnosis and efficient treatment. In order to diagnose CKD, this study analyses clinical and demographic data using machine learning models such as Random Forest, XGBoost, and Support Vector Machines (SVM). The research assesses these models' performances, finds key features for diagnosis, and adjusts model parameters for predicted accuracy using a dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The study highlights the expanding potential of predictive healthcare and aids in the creation of reliable diagnostic tools. Measures like as F1 score, accuracy, precision, and support are used to identify the top-performing model.

OBJECTIVES

The following are the project's main goals:

To assess the effectiveness of many machine learning models in predicting Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD), such as Random Forest, XGBoost, and Support Vector Machines (SVM).

To determine the essential clinical and demographic characteristics that are important for diagnosing chronic kidney disease.

To improve the efficacy and accuracy of the model by applying hyperparameter optimisation approaches.

To offer a fair assessment by looking at the dataset's and the models' limitations.

RESEARCH QUESTION

How do different machine learning models compare in their effectiveness for predicting Chronic Kidney Disease based on clinical and demographic features?
